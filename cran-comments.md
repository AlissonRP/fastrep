* This is a new release.

## Resubmission
* The files in inst/rmarkdown/templates/ are templates to create reports in pdf format, so title: "title" is just to indicate that the user will put the title of report there, I can write "Write your title here" or stuff like that,  but anyway the user has to delete this provisional title, so I decided to put minimal information.
